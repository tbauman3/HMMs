## Topic outline
This project explores the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which assumes a hidden process described by a Markov chain that influences observed data. HMMs are unique in that they consider unobservable causality. Formulated in the 19th century by Andrey Markov, HMMs gained traction in the 1960s and 1970s with the development of algorithms like forward, Viterbi, and Baum-Welch. These algorithms help identify parameters that fit observed data and uncover hidden sequences.

HMMs are widely applied in natural language processing, speech recognition, and biomedical analysis. This project will cover theoretical concepts, challenges, and solutions related to HMMs. It will also demonstrate their application in financial regime detection, addressing the complexities of financial data with changing behavioral patterns.
